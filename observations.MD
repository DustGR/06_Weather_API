![Lat vs Temp](output_data/Temperature_Scatter.png)
Temperatures are higher closer to the equator.

The random selection of cities includes a greater number of cities in the northern hemisphere
than in the southern hemisphere - a natural result of the commonly known fact that there is more inhabitable
land surface in the northern hemisphere.

![Lat vs Humidity](output_data/Humidity_Scatter.png)
There is a small trend toward higher humidty roughly 30 degrees latitude from the equator.

![Lat vs Cloudiness](output_data/Cloudiness_Scatter.png)
Cloudiness does not appear to be associated with latitude.

![Lat vs Wind Speed](output_data/Wind_Speed_Scatter.png)
Wind speed increases at latitudes are higher than 60 degrees latitude.
Data is limited for cities lower than 60 degrees latitude.
